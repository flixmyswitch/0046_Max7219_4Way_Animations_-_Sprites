Looking for two new subscribers today to get me over the 100 barrier.  Who will be number 100?

Original code found here https://youtu.be/oZDFh95Tt_E and then modified to my design

The library implements functions that allow the MAX72xx to be used for LED matrices (64 individual LEDs), allowing the programmer to use the LED matrix as a pixel device, displaying graphics elements much like any other pixel addressable display.
